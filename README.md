Soundscape
==========

Every time we visit a new place, we learn about the area mostly from our eyes. Soundscapes takes any travel or visit experience and adds an additional layer of sound.

Soundscapes plays music (and other sounds like radio podcasts) from artists originally from your current location. Unlike the radio, which usually plays top hits (not indicative of any given location), Soundscapes gives you a natural and realistic representation of your current city's culture and tastes. If you really love a particular song, you can press the thumbs up button to give the artist a shout out on Twitter and help spread their work!

The implications for this app are especially exciting for roadtrips, since you will be able to continuously listen to artists from your current location while you drive.

Soundscapes is ready to go on both iOS, Windows, and Android.
